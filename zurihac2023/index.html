  <h2>What?</h2>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> community
    event in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
    coding festival organized by
    <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell</a>.
    It is not your standard conference with papers and presentations, but
    features fantastic keynotes, hands-on tracks, hacking on many of your
    favourite projects, and of course lots of socializing!
  </p>
  <p>
    ZuriHac takes place <strong>Saturday 10 June — Monday 12 June</strong>
    2023 as a <strong>physical event</strong> at the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">beautiful
    Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST</a> located right next to lake Zürich.
    We hope to see you there!

  <h2>GHC</h2>
  <p>
    The
    <a href="https://haskell.foundation/">Haskell Foundation</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a>
    development team are in the process of organizing a three-day workshop on
    contributing to GHC, to be held at the same venue as Zurihac immediately
    prior, on 7-9 June. Full details
    are not yet available, but if you're interested, please fill out this
    <a href="https://www.surveylegend.com/survey/-NMhU1lOkDYNNC5tnpTZ">survey</a>.

<h1>Support</h1>
<section>
  <h2 id="scholarships">Scholarships</h2>
  <p>
    Switzerland can be expensive for people visiting from abroad. ZuriHac is a
    free event, but transportation, lodging, and food might discourage somebody
    without a good income from attending. We want to make it easier for anyone
    to come, and contribute towards making the Haskell community exciting and
    diverse.  For that reason, we will provide a small number of scholarships.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>What does this involve?  How do I apply?</summary>
    <p>
      Because we do not charge anything for tickets, our budget is limited,
      so we'll distribute the scholarships on a first come, first serve
      basis. Anybody accepted will be supported with an amount between 100.- and
      500.- Swiss Francs, depending on your expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our focus is on people with limited financial means and underrepresented
      groups in tech—the latter includes, but is not limited to: people of
      color, anyone identifying as LGBTQIA+, women, and disabled people.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can apply by sending an email to scholarships@zfoh.ch, and tell us why
      you are interested in joining the event and how a scholarship would help?
      Don't write an essay, a couple of sentences are enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we confirm your scholarship, please book your transport and
      accommodation, and send us the receipts and IBAN information for the wire
      transfer. Once we get your receipts, we'll wire you the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not disclose the recipients of these scholarships, in order to
      protect their privacy. The amount you estimate for your expenses will not
      be a factor when we consider your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't be shy and just contact us if you feel that this can make a
      difference to you. There is no downside to applying, and we will never
      disclose your identity.
