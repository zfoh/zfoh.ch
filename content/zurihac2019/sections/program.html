  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    ZuriHac focuses on three goals:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to work on interesting open source projects;</li>
    <li>to learn more about our favorite programming language; and</li>
    <li>to have fun and build a community!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is not a conference.  Most of the time is reserved to work on
    projects together with other attendees.  At the start of the Hackathon,
    project maintainers get a few moments to present their project; this way
    interested attendees of all skill levels can join up with them and get some
    Haskell coding done.
  </p>
  <p>
    We all want to learn something as well, so the day is broken up by
    <a href="#speakers">keynotes from well-known Haskellers</a>.
    In addition to that, there are some free
    <a href="#beginner-course">courses you can</a>
    <a href="#advanced-course">take as well</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please <a href="#contact">contact</a> us if you have more questions about
    the schedule.

  <h2>Beginner Info</h2>
  <p>
    We want to make the event accessible to Haskellers at all levels.  This is
    why we have dedicated mentors and beginner-level Haskell exercises every
    year, and 2019 will be the second year to feature an introductory course
    by Julie Moronuki.
  </p>

  <h3>Mentors</h3>
  <p>
    You can identify mentors from the black Zurihac shirt.  They welcome any
    questions you may have, so please grab them if you have any issues or
    questions.
  </p>

    <a href="https://twitter.com/argumatronic">Julie Moronuki</a>,
    the co-author of both
    <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">Haskell Programming from first principles</a>
    and
    <a href="https://joyofhaskell.com/">The Joy of Haskell</a>,
    has kindly agreed to teach a <em>free beginners course</em> for people who
    are just getting started with Haskell.  This beginner track will run on
    Friday and Saturday afternoon and will not conflict with any keynotes.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Important update:</strong> unfortunately, Julie will not be able to
    make it to ZuriHac this year.
    <a href="https://twitter.com/panicwhenever">Ryan Moore</a> will be teaching
    the beginners course in her abscence.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="advanced-course"></div>
  <h2>Advanced course</h2>
  <p>
    For those who are already comfortable with Haskell, but want to learn a bit
    more about this interesting language, we will organise a more advanced
    course in addition to the beginner course.
    These two courses will run in parallel on Friday and Saturday afternoon.
  </p>
  <p>
    It will be lead by the Haskell experts at
    <a href="http://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a>.  We will publish some
    subjects that will be covered in this course here soon.
