Mehta: Towards Type-Directed API Search for Mainstream Languages</a><p class="meetup-time">Thursday 28 November, 19:15</p><p>After a short lightning talk on the topic last year, Marc Etter and Farhad Mehta are back with a talk about type-based search for non-ML languages. TL;DR: In case you like Hoogle, and want to know how the Curry-Howard correspondence could be used as inspiration to implement something like Hoogle for mainstream languages such as Java or TypeScript, this talk is for you.</p> <p>Software developers spend a lot of their time finding and composing pre-existing functions from various libraries. Almost all developers today use general-purpose search engines for this search. Specialized search engines such as Hoogle for Haskell additionally use type information to improve this search, and have been successful for some typed functional programming languages. The options currently available for type-directed search for mainstream object-oriented languages is limited. Existing approaches for these languages do not have first-class support for subtyping or parametric polymorphism. The splitting and composition of a desired functionality into and from a number of pre-existing functions is also a task that needs to be done manually. In this talk we present a proof-search-based approach to type-directed search with first-class support for subtyping, parametric polymorphism, splitting, and composition. The approach is language agnostic, and can be specialized to simultaneously support multiple typed object-oriented languages. Given that most mainstream languages fall under this category, this approach would extend the benefits of type-directed search to the majority of programmers. As a proof of concept, we will demonstrate typesearch.dev: a running implementation of the core language-agnostic approach and extended to support the Java programming language. Further extensions would allow the tool to simultaneously support multiple programming languages using the same query syntax.</p> <p>This talk was originally given at the Type-Driven Development (TyDe) Workshop at the International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) in Milan, Italy on[masked].</p> <p>As usual, there will be the opportunity for drinks and socializing after the talk. There is a Zurihac organizers meeting right before it, so if you're interested in volunteering, please feel free to sign up for that as well!</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/304432396/">Zurihac 2025 Organizers Meeting</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/303411665/">Julian Kirsten Arni: Haskell on Nix, from Development to Production</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/299673998/">(External) Richard Stallman: Free Software and Your Freedom</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/299591887/">Cazim Hysi: We&#39;re all already using Comonads</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/299490906/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/297196479/">Zurihac 2024: Organizer Meering</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/296893251/">Auke Booij: What are exact real numbers?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/296055315/">Dominic Egger: Dynamic Logic for verifiable data collection processes</a></li><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/294293599/">Eliane Schmidli: Hardware Control using Haskell</a></li></ul></div></div>
