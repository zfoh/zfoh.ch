  <h2>TRACK_INFO</h2>
  <p>
    We have a number of tracks for all you knowledge-hungry people.
  </p>
  <p>
    These cover any level between beginner and expert, and we've taken special care to have
    content for intermediate Haskell programmers. There has never been a better time
    to learn some real-world applied Haskell skills!
  </p>
  <div class="tracks">

    <div class="track">
      <h3>Advanced Track</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to last year, we have the privilege to get advanced Haskell training from
        our friends at <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a>. This will take
        the form of two independent sessions, distributed over the course of two days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watch this space for the announcement of the specific topics, or check out last year's
        recordings for a taste:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/pwnrfREbhWY">Datatype-Generic Programming</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/RknM0j138PE">Haskell and InfoSec</a>

      <h3>GHC Track</h3>
      <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
        type specimen book.
      </p>

    <div class="track">
      <h3>Unison workshop</h3>
      <p>
        Unison is an exciting new programming language that shares Haskell's syntax and semantics
        (in addition to being implemented in it).
        The big ideas in Unison are content-addressable code and a focus on creating a language
        in which it is natural to express distributed systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rúnar Bjarnason of <a href="https://www.unisonweb.org/unisoncomputing/">Unison Computing</a>
        will give you an intro to the language, and hold a hands-on tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can't wait, check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/gCWtkvDQ2ZI">2019 Strangeloop</a>
        introduction to the language.

    <div class="track">
      <h3>IHP workshop</h3>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP web framework</a> is an
        up-and-coming web framework that has been compared to Ruby-on-Rails. It has
        been received with a lot of excitement, since it comes with highly polished tools
        and doesn't need deep technical knowledge to build useful websites very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creators of IHP, <a href="https://digitallyinduced.com/">digitally induced</a>,
        will hold tutorials that teach you how to get productive with the framework.
        We recommend that even total beginners check it out,
        as some people have learned Haskell simply through using IHP for a practical application.
