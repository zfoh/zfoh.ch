  <h1>Registration</h1>
  <p>
    The Hackathon is completely free but the number of participants is limited
    to 500 people.  To this end, it is very important to us that you timely
    cancel your registration in case you cannot attend.  Around two months
    before the Hackathon, we will ask you to <em>confirm</em> your registration
    and after that you will be able to access your ticket.
