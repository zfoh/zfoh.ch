  <h2>What?</h2>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> community
    event in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
    coding festival co-organized by
    the <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en">OST Eastern Switzerland University of
    Applied Science</a>.
    It is not your standard conference with papers and presentations, but
    features fantastic keynotes, hands-on tracks, hacking on many of your
    favourite projects, and of course lots of socializing!
  </p>
  <p>
    ZuriHac takes place <strong>Saturday 10 June — Monday 12 June</strong>
    2023 as a <strong>physical event</strong> at the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">beautiful
    Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST</a> located right next to lake Zürich.
    We hope to see you there!

  <h2>Schedule</h2>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is primarily a community event and a hackathon, rather than a
    conference.  Aside from the talks and tracks, attendees are encouraged to
    work together on all sorts of Haskell-related open-source projects and
    socialize.  Trying to attend everything may a bit too much, just pick
    what you find interesting!

  <h2 id="advanced">Lazy Evaluation</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Lazy Evaluation by Andres Löh</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this workshop, we are going to take a deep dive into lazy evaluation,
    looking at several examples and reasoning about how they get evaluated. The
    goal is to develop a strong understanding of how Haskell’s evaluation
    strategy works. Hopefully, we will see why laziness is a compelling idea
    with a lot of strong points, while also learning how some common sources of
    space leaks can be avoided.
  </p>
  <p>
    The workshop will be accessible to anyone who has mastered the basics of
    Haskell and is looking to understand the language in more depth, whether
    they are a student or professional developer. We are not going to use any
    advanced features of the language, and you do not have to be a Haskell
    expert to attend!

    Over the past ten years, we've exclusively held invited talks at ZuriHac.
    However, we're always interested in changing things up a little and making
    incremental improvements.  Since there was strong interest for this, we
    organized a CFP this year to allocate six 20-minute slots:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <strong>Saturday</strong>
    <li>Philip Hazelden: Three configurable prettyprinters</li>
    <li>Las Safin: Free without Pure: eDSL framework Plutarch</li>
    <li>Hécate: Functional Web Application Architecture with Flora.pm</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <strong>Sunday</strong>
    <li>George Thomas: Primer: pedagogical functional programming</li>

<section>
  <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>
  <h3>How to get there by train</h3>
  <p>
    We recommend attendees to use public transportation.  You can take the S5,
    S7 or S15 trains to get from the Zürich main station to Rapperswil. These
    trains run regularly in 30 minute intervals.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>What train tickets do I need?</summary>
    <p>
      If you stay in Zürich city, the easiest option is to get a 24 hour pass
      for <strong>all zones</strong>. It's good for all public transportation
      around Zürich, up to Rapperswil. A one-way ticket costs 17.20CHF, the 24
      hour pass 34.40CHF.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that the 24 hour pass is literally a 24 hour pass and can
      be used over multiple days: e.g. if you buy one on the first day of the
      Hackathon at e.g. 9.00 AM, you can still use it to take the train at
      8.00 AM the next day. This way, it is possible to buy only two tickets
      for the three-day conference.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lightly cheaper alternative to the 24 hour pass is the
      <a href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/9-oclock-daypass.html">9 O&#39;Clock day pass</a>
      which works more like a regular day pass.  However, this requires you to
      take the train to Rapperswil after 09:00 AM on weekdays, as described on
      the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can buy tickets from the SBB or ZVV vending machines, which have a
      button to use them in English rather than German on the home screen.

      Alternatively, you can use the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/buying/pages/fahrplan/fahrplan.xhtml">SBB website</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile.html">SBB mobile app</a>
      on
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.sbb.mobile.android.b2c">Android</a>
      or
      <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/sbb-mobile/id294855237">iOS</a>.
    </p>
  </details>
  <h3>How to get there by car</h3>
  <p>
    There are some paid public parking lots in walking distance from the
    campus
    (<a href="https://www.ost.ch/de/die-ost/campus/campus-rapperswil-jona">see
    here for a map</a>).  It can be difficult to find a free parking spot
    in these lots, and you can expect to pay about CHF 20 per day.  We
    therefore recommend that you come via public transport if possible.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="accomodation">Accomodation</h2>
  <h3>Where to stay</h3>
  <p>
    The accommodation situation in and around Rapperswil is, unfortunately like
    every year, tight.  Summer, regardless of the weekend, is a very popular
    time in the area, with something or the other always going on; this year a
    popular IRONMAN challenge takes place there.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>What alternatives are there to Rapperswil?</summary>
    <p>
      The nearby city of Zurich has a much larger capacity of hotels and
      accommodations of varying types. The public transport to Rapperswil is
      frequent, convenient, and fast. The following stations have direct train
      connections to Rapperswil every 30 minutes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zurich Hardbrücke</li>
      <li>Zurich Hauptbahnhof</li>
      <li>Zurich Stadelhofen</li>
      <li>Zurich Oerlikon</li>
      <li>Zurich Altstetten</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      During previous years, attendees have also shared accomodation (e.g. on
      <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>).  In order to get in touch with
      fellow attendees, we recommend using the <code>#accomodation</code> channel
      in our Discord (which you can join upon registration).
    </p>
    <p>
      If weather allows for it, camping is also a very affordable and beautiful
      option for the ultimate grassroots ZuriHac festival fans.  Several people
      have stayed at
      <a href="https://www.rapperswil-zuerichsee.ch/de/besuchen/unterkunft/camping-im-strandbad-stampf">this campsite</a>
      in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022.

  <h2 id="scholarships">Scholarships</h2>
  <p>
    Switzerland can be expensive for people visiting from abroad. ZuriHac is a
    free event, but transportation, lodging, and food might discourage somebody
    without a good income from attending. We want to make it easier for anyone
    to come, and contribute towards making the Haskell community exciting and
    diverse.  For that reason, we will provide a small number of scholarships.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Update:</strong> we have allocated all of the budget we had
    available for scholarships this year and will no longer be accepting
    new candidates.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>What does this involve?  How do I apply?</summary>
    <p>
      Because we do not charge anything for tickets, our budget is limited,
      so we'll distribute the scholarships on a first come, first serve
      basis. Anybody accepted will be supported with an amount between 100.- and
      500.- Swiss Francs, depending on your expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our focus is on people with limited financial means and underrepresented
      groups in tech—the latter includes, but is not limited to: people of
      color, anyone identifying as LGBTQIA+, women, and disabled people.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can apply by sending an email to scholarships@zfoh.ch, and tell us why
      you are interested in joining the event and how a scholarship would help?
      Don't write an essay, a couple of sentences are enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we confirm your scholarship, please book your transport and
      accommodation, and send us the receipts and IBAN information for the wire
      transfer. Once we get your receipts, we'll wire you the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not disclose the recipients of these scholarships, in order to
      protect their privacy. The amount you estimate for your expenses will not
      be a factor when we consider your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't be shy and just contact us if you feel that this can make a
      difference to you. There is no downside to applying, and we will never
      disclose your identity.
