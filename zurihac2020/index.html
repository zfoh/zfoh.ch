  <p class="question">What is ZuriHac?</p>

  <p class="answer">
    ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> Hackathon
    in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
    coding festival organized by
    <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell</a>.
    It features fantastic keynotes, interesting tracks, and of course lots of
    hacking and socializing!
  </p>

  <p class="question">When and where?</p>

  <p class="answer">
    ZuriHac 2020 takes place <strong>Friday 12 June to Sunday 14 June</strong>
    and is hosted at the
    <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/en/">HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a>.
    This modern venue is located right at lake Zürich and provides space for 500
    participants.
  </p>

  <p class="question">Who can attend?</p>

  <p class="answer">
    <strong>Everyone!</strong>  We will have a dedicated beginners' course, and
    there will be mentors and Haskell gurus on site whom you can directly
    approach during the whole event with any Haskell-related question you have.

  <div class="anchor" id="how-it-works"></div>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    ZuriHac focuses on three goals:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to work on interesting open source projects;</li>
    <li>to learn more about our favorite programming language; and</li>
    <li>to have fun and build a community!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is not a conference.  Most of the time is reserved to work on
    projects together.  At the start of the Hackathon maintainers get a few
    moments to present their project.  If you want, you can join any of these
    projects and learn, contribute code, write documentation, or make any other
    sort of progress.  There will be something for all skill levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course — in between hacking — we love learning from some of the most
    interesting Haskellers out there, so we have a couple of
    <a href="#speakers">invited talks from several amazing people</a>
    from both industry and academia, in addition to some free
    <a href="#tracks">tracks you can follow</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="tracks"></div>
  <h2>Tracks</h2>

  <div class="anchor" id="advanced-track"></div>
  <h3>Advanced track</h3>
  <p>
    The Haskell experts from <a href="http://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a>
    will teach a two-part course in the advanced track.  The two sessions cover
    different subjects and are completely independent.  They will take place on
    Friday and Saturday afternoon.  The exact topics will be announced here
    before the event.
  </p>

    We're excited that
    <a href="https://twitter.com/argumatronic">Julie Moronuki</a> from
    <a href="https://joyofhaskell.com/">Joy of Haskell</a> and
    <a href="https://typeclasses.com/">Type Classes</a> will be teaching
    the beginners course again this year.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beginners course focuses on Haskell language fundamentals and requires
    no prior experience with the language.  It will take place in two
    parts, on Friday and Saturday afternoon.  We will post detailed installation
    instructions here prior to the event, so you will be able to dive right in!

<div class="anchor" id="registration"></div>
<h1>Registration</h1>
<section>
  <p>
    The Hackathon is completely free but the number of participants is limited
    to 500 people.  To this end, it is very important to us that you timely
    cancel your registration in case you cannot attend.  Around two months
    before the Hackathon, we will ask you to <em>confirm</em> your registration
    and after that you will be able to access your ticket.
  </p>
  <div class="raise">
    <p>
      <a href="https://zureg.zfoh.ch/register/" target="_blank">Register for ZuriHac 2020</a>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    Once we reach maximum capacity you will be queued into a wait list.  In case
    that somebody cancels we will fill up the seats from the wait list in first
    come first serve order and let you know.  Please do not book anything before
    we have confirmed a seat for you in a confirmation email.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="scholarships"></div>
  <h2>Scholarships</h2>
  <p>
    Switzerland can be expensive for people visiting from abroad. ZuriHac is a
    free event, but transportation, lodging, and food might discourage somebody
    without a good income from attending.  We want to make it easier for anyone
    to come, and contribute towards making the Haskell community exciting and
    diverse.
  </p>
  <p>
    For that reason, we will provide a small number of scholarships this year.
    Because we do not charge anything for tickets, our budget is limited
    and we can only support attendees by reimbursing between 100.- and 500.-
    Swiss Francs, depending on your expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our focus is on people with limited financial means and underrepresented
    groups in tech -- the latter includes, but is not limited to: people of
    colour, anyone identifying as LGBTQIA+, women, and disabled people.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can apply by sending an email to
    <a href="mailto:scholarships@zfoh.ch">scholarships@zfoh.ch</a>, and include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A rough breakdown of your cost estimates (flight, train tickets,
      hotel/hostel/airbnb, food...).
    </li>
    <li>
      Why are you interested in functional programming?  Don't write an essay:
      one or two sentences should be enough.
    </li>
    <li>
      What makes you eligible?  Again, keep this brief, and please only
      share what you are comfortable with.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We will not disclose the recipients of these scholarships, in order to
    protect their privacy.  The amount you estimate for your expenses will not
    be a factor when we consider your application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't be shy and just contact us if you feel that this can make a difference
    to you. There is no downside to applying, and we will never disclose your
    identity.

  <p>
    The Hackathon mainly takes place in two buildings: Building 1 and
    Building 4.  Detailed info on the different rooms will be announced later.
    The venue is located right next to the lake, and weather has been superb
    (25°C, 77℉) during the previous years, so feel free to bring your swimming
    gear!

  <div class="anchor" id="getting-there"></div>
  <h2>Getting there</h2>

  <div class="anchor" id="getting-there-by-train"></div>
  <h3>By Train</h3>
  <p>
    You can take the S7 or S15 to get from the Zurich main station to
    Rapperswil.  These trains run regularly in 30 minute and 60 minute
    intervals, respectively.  Google maps works well for directions if you use
    the "public transport" tab.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you arrive at the Zurich airport, first take the train to the Zurich main
    station and then continue with S7 or S15. Trains from the airport towards
    the city run every few minutes.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="train-tickets"></div>
  <h3>Train tickets</h3>
  <p>
    If you stay in Zurich city, the easiest option is to get a 24 hour pass for
    <strong>all zones</strong>. It's good for all public transportation around
    Zurich, up to Rapperswil. A one-way ticket costs 17.20CHF, the 24 hour pass
    34.40CHF.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that the 24 hour pass is literally a 24 hour pass and can be
    used over multiple days: e.g. if you buy one on the first day of the
    Hackathon at e.g. 9.00, you can still use it to take the train at 8.00 the
    next day. This way, it is possible to buy only two tickets for the three-day
    conference.
  </p>

  <p>
    A lightly cheaper alternative to the 24 hour pass is the
    <a href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/9-oclock-daypass.html">9 O&#39;Clock day pass</a>
    which works more like a regular day pass.  However, this requires you to
    take the train to Rapperswil after 09:00 on Friday, as described on the
    website.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can buy tickets from the SBB or ZVV vending machines, which have a
    button to use them in English rather than German on the home screen.

    Alternatively, you can use the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/service/apps/ticket-app.html">ZVV ticket app</a>
    on
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mnc.android.zvvticket">Android</a>
    or
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/zvv-tickets/id1033896474?mt=8">iOS</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="getting-there-by-car"></div>
  <h3>By Car</h3>
  <p>
    There are some paid public parking lots in walking distance from the
    campus
    (<a href="https://www.hsr.ch/en/contact-and-directions/">see here for a
    map</a>).  It can be difficult to find a free parking spot in these lots,
    and you can expect to pay about CHF 20 per day.  We therefore recommend
    that you come via public transport if possible.
  </p>

  <h2 id="accomodation">Accomodation</h2>
  <p>
    As for accomodation, there are two options.  You can either stay in Zurich,
    or in Rapperswil itself.  Both have advantages and disadvantages: there are
    more things to do in Zurich, but you can save time and transportation costs
    by staying in Rapperswil.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have negotiated some rates with hotels near the venue.  You can find all
    that information in
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=11I8ssGBJeGYpkLsecXiCxJOgKsiMn_qp">this spreadsheet</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    During previous years, attendees have also shared accomodation (e.g. on
    <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>).  In order to get in touch with
    fellow attendees, we recommend using the <code>#accomodation</code> channel
    in our <a href="https://slack.zurihac.info">Slack chat</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If weather allows for it, camping is also a very affordable and beautiful
    option for the ultimate grassroots ZuriHac festival fans.  Several people
    have stayed at
    <a href="https://www.rapperswil-zuerichsee.ch/de/besuchen/unterkunft/camping-im-strandbad-stampf">this campsite</a>
    in 2017, 2018 and 2019.
  </p>

  <h2 id="getting-around">Getting around</h2>
  <p>
    See <a target='_blank' href='https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1OmDEXl-VKylIyv2Or-yH0nqah38'>this map</a>

    places.

    Some folks keep the good times going by going straight from ZuriHac to <a target='_blank' href='https://monadic.party'>monadic.party</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
