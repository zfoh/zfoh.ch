      <h1>ZÃ¼rich Friends of Haskell</h1>
      <p>
        The ZÃ¼rich Friends of Haskell is a club founded to foster the
        worldwide knowledge of functional programming, and Haskell in
        particular.  We organise
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/" target="_blank">meetups</a>
        and
        <a href="https://zurihac.com/" target="_blank">events</a>
        in the ZÃ¼rich area.

    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.

    <h3>Become a member!</h3>
    <p>
      For members, we ask a yearly contribution of either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>giving at least one talk at the Zurich HaskellerZ meetup,</li>
      <li>helping organize ZuriHac in an official role,</li>
      <li>serving on the board of directors for the Zurich Friends of Haskell, or</li>
      <li>providing other voluntary work asked for by the board of directors.</li>
    </ol>

      Occasionally, we reach out to our members with volunteering opportunities. Also, once a year we would send you an email to confirm and update the membership.

<h2>HaskellerZ meetups</h2><p>The next meetup takes place Thursday 24 April, 19:00.</p><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/307298800/">Igor Moreno: Sound Notional Machines</a></p><p>Teachers often resort to diagrams or other pedagogic devices to help explain how programs work. In computing education, these are called notional machines. But how can we know that a notional machine is indeed consistent with what it aims to represent? How can we know if it is sound?
In this talk, we will show how we can use well-known techniques from programming language theory to reason about notional machines. With these tools, we can find inconsistencies in existing notional machines, propose solutions to fix them, and build notional machines that are sound by construction.
And, of course, we will do it using Haskell. ðŸ¦¥âœ¨</p>
<p>As usual, there will be the opportunity for drinks and socializing after the talk.</p>

<h2 id="zurihac">ZuriHac</h2>
<p>
  Our main yearly event is the organisation of
  <a href="https://zurihac.com">ZuriHac</a>, a yearly Haskell Hackathon that
  attracts over 300 attendees. It is probably one of the oldest and definitely
  the largest Haskell Hackathon currently in existence.
</p>
<p>
  The first ZuriHac was organised in 2010 at the ZÃ¼rich Google office by Johan
  Tibell and Christophe Poucet. Currently, we are organising it at the
  <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST</a>,
  with the help of many ZÃ¼rich Friends of Haskell members and volunteers.

<p>
  We try to record all of our meetups and keynotes so Friends of Haskell who are
  not in the ZÃ¼rich area can enjoy the content as well.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiU7KJ5_df6YRVS8CMoedeFHamRgiJkwQ">This playlist</a>
  contains all our Haskell-related videos.
</p>
<p>
  We have also collected the slides of the presentations in
  <a href="https://github.com/meiersi/HaskellerZ/">this repository</a>.
  Unfortunately, the collection is currently incomplete.
