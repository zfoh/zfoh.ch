      <h1>Zürich Friends of Haskell</h1>
      <p>
        The Zürich Friends of Haskell is a club founded to foster the
        worldwide knowledge of functional programming, and Haskell in
        particular.  We organise
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/" target="_blank">meetups</a>
        and
        <a href="https://zurihac.com/" target="_blank">events</a>
        in the Zürich area.

    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.

    <h3>Become a member!</h3>
    <p>
      For members, we ask a yearly contribution of either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>giving at least one talk at the Zurich HaskellerZ meetup,</li>
      <li>helping organize ZuriHac in an official role,</li>
      <li>serving on the board of directors for the Zurich Friends of Haskell, or</li>
      <li>providing other voluntary work asked for by the board of directors.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>HaskellerZ meetups</h2><p>The next meetup takes place Friday 21 March, 18:00.</p><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/306393870/">Zurich Friends of Haskell - General Assembly</a></p><p>Every year the Zurich Friends of Haskell meet for a general assembly as per the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8eHAK40hiH5jv79AscWtf3pyUNxx4Ls1LwkpLYK--8/edit?usp=sharing">statutes of the association</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Zurich Friends of Haskell is to organize ZuriHac and the HaskellerZ meetup. The general assembly gives you the opportunity to learn what the association has been doing in the year 2024 and to contribute to ZuriHac, the HaskellerZ meetup, and the Haskell community in Zurich.</p>
<p>The general assembly is open to all members of the ZFoH. If you are not a member yet, please head over to <a href="https://zfoh.ch">the ZFoH website</a> and sign up for membership.</p>
<p>The agenda is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The board will present a summary of the association’s activities in 2024.</li>
<li>The treasurer will present the financial report for 2024.</li>
<li>We vote to discharge the board for their work in 2024.</li>
<li>We will discuss the goals and aspirations of the association for 2025.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please let us know, if you have further topics you would like to discuss.</p>
<p>Note, members of the ZFoH will receive a separate invitation via email. Please RSVP to this meetup event anyway so we get an accurate picture of who will be attending. Thank you!</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you at the GA!</p>
<p>PS: We’re holding a regular HaskellerZ meetup right after the general assembly, to be announced as a separate Meetup event. Please RSVP for that event separately once it is announced.</p>

<h2 id="zurihac">ZuriHac</h2>
<p>
  Our main yearly event is the organisation of
  <a href="https://zurihac.com">ZuriHac</a>, a yearly Haskell Hackathon that
  attracts over 300 attendees. It is probably one of the oldest and definitely
  the largest Haskell Hackathon currently in existence.
</p>
<p>
  The first ZuriHac was organised in 2010 at the Zürich Google office by Johan
  Tibell and Christophe Poucet. Currently, we are organising it at the
  <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST</a>,
  with the help of many Zürich Friends of Haskell members and volunteers.

  We try to record all of our meetups and keynotes so Friends of Haskell who are
  not in the Zürich area can enjoy the content as well.

  We have also collected the slides of the presentations in
