<h2>HaskellerZ meetups</h2><p>The next meetup takes place Thursday 24 April, 19:00.</p><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/307298800/">Igor Moreno: Sound Notional Machines</a></p><p>Teachers often resort to diagrams or other pedagogic devices to help explain how programs work. In computing education, these are called notional machines. But how can we know that a notional machine is indeed consistent with what it aims to represent? How can we know if it is sound?
In this talk, we will show how we can use well-known techniques from programming language theory to reason about notional machines. With these tools, we can find inconsistencies in existing notional machines, propose solutions to fix them, and build notional machines that are sound by construction.
And, of course, we will do it using Haskell. ðŸ¦¥âœ¨</p>
<p>As usual, there will be the opportunity for drinks and socializing after the talk.</p>
