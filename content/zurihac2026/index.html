    ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> community
    event in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
    coding festival co-organized by
    the <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en">OST Eastern Switzerland University of
    Applied Science</a>.
    It is not your standard conference with papers and presentations, but
    features fantastic keynotes, hands-on tracks, hacking on many of your
    favourite projects, <!-- TODO: link projects -->
    and of course lots of socializing!
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>ZuriHac 2026</strong> takes place
    <strong>Saturday 6 June — Monday 8 June</strong>
    as a <strong>physical event</strong> at the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">beautiful
    Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST</a> located right next to lake Zürich.
    We hope to see you there!

<section>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is primarily a community event and a hackathon, rather than a
    conference.  Aside from the talks and tracks, attendees are encouraged to
    work together on all sorts of Haskell-related open-source projects and
    socialize.  Trying to attend everything may a bit too much, so our
    recommendation is just pick to what you find interesting!
  </p>
  <!-- TODO: projects list

  <h2 id="accomodation">Accomodation</h2>
  <h3>Where to stay</h3>
  <p>
    A well-known triathlon is taking place the same weekend in Rapperswil,
    so accomodation close to the venue is very hard to find.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>What alternatives are there to Rapperswil?</summary>
    <p>
      The nearby city of Zurich has a huge capacity of hotels and accommodations
      of varying types. The public transport to Rapperswil is frequent,
      convenient, and fast: most of the organizers commute in from the greateer
      Zurich area. The following stations have direct train connections
      to Rapperswil every 30 minutes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zurich Hardbrücke</li>
      <li>Zurich Hauptbahnhof</li>
      <li>Zurich Stadelhofen</li>
      <li>Zurich Oerlikon</li>
      <li>Zurich Altstetten</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are also many cities and towns around the lake area with fast and
      frequent connections to Rapperswil:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kaltbrunn</li>
      <li>Männedorf</li>
      <li>Meilen</li>
      <li>Pfäffikon SZ</li>
      <li>Stäfa</li>
      <li>Uetikon</li>
      <li>Uster</li>
      <li>Uznach</li>
      <li>Wädenswil</li>
      <li>Wattwil</li>
      <li>Wetzikon</li>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      During previous years, attendees have also shared accomodation (e.g. on
      <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>).  In order to get in touch with
      fellow attendees, we recommend using the <code>#accomodation</code> channel
      in our Discord (which you can join upon registration).
    </p>
    <p>
      If weather allows for it, camping is also a very affordable and beautiful
      option for the ultimate grassroots ZuriHac festival fans.  Several people
      have stayed at
      <a href="https://www.rapperswil-zuerichsee.ch/de/besuchen/unterkunft/camping-im-strandbad-stampf">this campsite</a>
      since 2017.
    </p>
  </details>

  <h2 id="getting-to-the-venue">Getting to the venue</h2>
  <div class="ink-left ink-05"></div>
  <h3>How to get there by train</h3>
  <p>
    We recommend attendees to use public transportation.  You can take the S5,
    S7 or S15 trains to get from the Zürich main station to Rapperswil. These
    trains run regularly in 30 minute intervals.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>What train tickets do I need?</summary>
    <p>
      If you stay in Zürich city, the easiest option is to get a 24 hour pass
      for <strong>all zones</strong>. It's good for all public transportation
      around Zürich, up to Rapperswil. A one-way ticket costs 17.20CHF, the 24
      hour pass 34.40CHF.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that the 24 hour pass is literally a 24 hour pass and can
      be used over multiple days: e.g. if you buy one on the first day of the
      Hackathon at e.g. 9.00 AM, you can still use it to take the train at
      8.00 AM the next day. This way, it is possible to buy only two tickets
      for the three-day conference.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lightly cheaper alternative to the 24 hour pass is the
      <a href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/9-oclock-daypass.html">9 O&#39;Clock day pass</a>
      which works more like a regular day pass.  However, this requires you to
      take the train to Rapperswil after 09:00 AM on weekdays, as described on
      the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can buy tickets from the SBB or ZVV vending machines, which have a
      button to use them in English rather than German on the home screen.

      Alternatively, you can use the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/buying/pages/fahrplan/fahrplan.xhtml">SBB website</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile.html">SBB mobile app</a>
      on
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.sbb.mobile.android.b2c">Android</a>
      or
      <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/sbb-mobile/id294855237">iOS</a>.
    </p>
  </details>
  <h3>How to get there by car</h3>
  <p>
    There are some paid public parking lots in walking distance from the
    campus
    (<a href="https://www.ost.ch/de/die-ost/campus/campus-rapperswil-jona">see
    here for a map</a>).  It can be difficult to find a free parking spot
    in these lots, and you can expect to pay about CHF 20 per day.  We
    therefore recommend that you come via public transport if possible.

    <strong>Photo Policy:</strong>
    The organizers as well as other participants may take photos during the
    event to use on social media, blogs and websites. We encourage this,
    as promoting the event helps our goal of bringing more people into the
    Haskell community. On the other hand, we want to respect the privacy of the
    attendees.
    Therefore, we ask everyone to be mindful and request explicit permission
    before taking pictures where people are clearly recognizable in the
    foreground.
