  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    ZuriHac focuses on three goals:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to work on interesting open source projects;</li>
    <li>to learn more about our favorite programming language; and</li>
    <li>to have fun and build a community!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is not a conference.  Most of the time is reserved to work on
    projects together.  At the start of the Hackathon maintainers get a few
    moments to present their project.  If you want, you can join any of these
    projects and learn, contribute code, write documentation, or make any other
    sort of progress.  There will be something for all skill levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will highlight a few projects on our website before the event.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course — in between hacking —  we love learning from some of the most
    interesting Haskellers out there, so we have a couple of
    <a href="#speakers">keynotes from several amazing people</a>
    from both industry and academia.

    In addition to that, there are some free
    <a href="#beginner-course">courses you can</a>
    <a href="#advanced-course">take as well</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please <a href="#contact">contact</a> us if you have more questions about
    the schedule.

  <h2>Beginner Info</h2>
  <p>
    We want to make the event accessible to Haskellers at all levels.  This is
    why we have dedicated mentors and beginner-level Haskell exercises every
    year, and 2019 will be the second year to feature an introductory course
    by Julie Moronuki.
  </p>

  <h3>Mentors</h3>
  <p>
    You can identify mentors from the black Zurihac shirt.  They welcome any
    questions you may have, so please grab them if you have any issues or
    questions.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="beginner-course"></div>

  <p>
    <strong>Important update:</strong> unfortunately, Julie will not be able to
    make it to ZuriHac this year.
    <a href="https://twitter.com/panicwhenever">Ryan Moore</a> will be teaching
    the beginners course in her absence.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://twitter.com/argumatronic">Julie Moronuki</a>,
    the co-author of both
    <a href="http://haskellbook.com/">Haskell Programming from first principles</a>
    and
    <a href="https://joyofhaskell.com/">The Joy of Haskell</a>,
    has kindly agreed to teach a <em>free beginners course</em> for people who
    are just getting started with Haskell.  This beginner track will run on
    Friday and Saturday afternoon and will not conflict with any keynotes.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="advanced-course"></div>
  <h2>Advanced course</h2>
  <p>
    Due to popular demand we are offering an advanced track for the first time.
    So if you already feel comfortable with the basics of Haskell, but are eager
    to learn more, then you will be able to register as soon as we publish the
    programme.
    This course will be lead by the Haskell experts from
    <a href="http://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a>.
