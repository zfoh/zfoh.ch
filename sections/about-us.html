    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.
