<p>The purpose of the Zurich Friends of Haskell is to organize ZuriHac and the HaskellerZ meetup. The general assembly gives you the opportunity to learn what the association has been doing in the year 2024 and to contribute to ZuriHac, the HaskellerZ meetup, and the Haskell community in Zurich.</p>
<p>The general assembly is open to all members of the ZFoH. If you are not a member yet, please head over to <a href="https://zfoh.ch">the ZFoH website</a> and sign up for membership.</p>
<p>The agenda is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The board will present a summary of the association’s activities in 2024.</li>
<li>The treasurer will present the financial report for 2024.</li>
<li>We vote to discharge the board for their work in 2024.</li>
<li>We will discuss the goals and aspirations of the association for 2025.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please let us know, if you have further topics you would like to discuss.</p>
<p>Note, members of the ZFoH will receive a separate invitation via email. Please RSVP to this meetup event anyway so we get an accurate picture of who will be attending. Thank you!</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you at the GA!</p>
<p>PS: We’re holding a regular HaskellerZ meetup right after the general assembly, to be announced as a separate Meetup event. Please RSVP for that event separately once it is announced.</p>
