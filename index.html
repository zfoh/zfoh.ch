      <h1>Zürich Friends of Haskell</h1>
      <p>
        The Zürich Friends of Haskell is a club founded to foster the
        worldwide knowledge of functional programming, and Haskell in
        particular.  We organise
        <a href="https://www.meetup.com/HaskellerZ/" target="_blank">meetups</a>
        and
        <a href="https://zurihac.com/" target="_blank">events</a>
        in the Zürich area.

    <p>
      The HaskellerZ meetup group has been around since 2011.  After organising
      many meetups and events, in particular ZuriHac, which attracts people from
      all over the world, there was a need to formalise our group a bit more.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short term, this allows us to work together better with sponsors
      for ZuriHac.  In the long term, however, we would like to guarantee the
      long-time success of a Zurich-based Haskell interest group, not dependent
      on one or two key volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rules are set up so that we encourage non-monetary contributions (e.g.
      giving a talk).  Of course, membership is optional and not required to
      attend any of our events.

    <h3>Become a member!</h3>
    <p>
      For members, we ask a yearly contribution of either:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>giving at least one talk at the Zurich HaskellerZ meetup,</li>
      <li>helping organize ZuriHac in an official role,</li>
      <li>serving on the board of directors for the Zurich Friends of Haskell, or</li>
      <li>providing other voluntary work asked for by the board of directors.</li>
    </ol>

      Occasionally, we reach out to our members with volunteering opportunities. Also, once a year we would send you an email to confirm and update the membership.

No prior knowledge of Nix is required, though familiarity with Linux or OS concepts will be helpful.</p> <p>Speaker bio: Alex has over a decade of experience making computers work for teams and projects of all sizes. As a champion of functional and declarative paradigms, he has managed to sneak Nix into both embedded systems and large-scale distributed projects. He is an organizer of international Haskell and Nix meetups, and likes to share his expertise while learning from the community. His mission: to make technology just a bit less frustrating for everyone.</p> <p>The lecture will take place in the lecture theatre 3.008 at the OST campus in Rapperswil.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/304434274/">M.

<h2 id="zurihac">ZuriHac</h2>
<p>
  Our main yearly event is the organisation of
  <a href="https://zurihac.com">ZuriHac</a>, a yearly Haskell Hackathon that
  attracts over 300 attendees. It is probably one of the oldest and definitely
  the largest Haskell Hackathon currently in existence.
</p>
<p>
  The first ZuriHac was organised in 2010 at the Zürich Google office by Johan
  Tibell and Christophe Poucet. Currently, we are organising it at the
  <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST</a>,
  with the help of many Zürich Friends of Haskell members and volunteers.

  We try to record all of our meetups and keynotes so Friends of Haskell who are
  not in the Zürich area can enjoy the content as well.

  We have also collected the slides of the presentations in
