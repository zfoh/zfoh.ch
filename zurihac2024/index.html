<h1>What is ZuriHac?</h1>

<section>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> community
    event in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
    coding festival co-organized by
    the <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell</a> and the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en">OST Eastern Switzerland University of
    Applied Science</a>.
    It is not your standard conference with papers and presentations, but
    features fantastic keynotes, hands-on tracks, hacking on many of your
    favourite <a href="/zurihac2024/projects/">projects</a>,
    and of course lots of socializing!
  </p>
  <p>
    ZuriHac takes place <strong>Saturday 8 June — Monday 10 June</strong>
    2024 as a <strong>physical event</strong> at the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">beautiful
    Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST</a> located right next to lake Zürich.
    We hope to see you there!

<h1 class="color0">Talks</h1>
<section>
  <h2 id="talk-ivan-perez">“Haskell in Space: A New Horizon” by Ivan Perez</h2>
  <p>
    In this talk, we'll discuss how Haskell is being used for runtime
    verification of systems in safety critical domains, what steps are needed
    to make Haskell adopted by engineers, and how we could build the next
    generation of tools to keep systems and humans safe as we venture towards
    space.
  </p>
  <h2 id="talk-ningning-xie">“Algebraic Effect Handlers with Parallelizable Computations” by Ningning Xie</h2>
  <p>
    Algebraic effects and handlers are a powerful way to incorporate effects
    in programming languages. Algebraic effect handlers can express any free
    monad in a concise and composable way, and can be used to express complex
    control-flow, like exceptions, asynchronous I/O, local state, backtracking,
    and many more. However, existing designs of algebraic effects often require
    effects to be executed sequentially.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this talk, I give an overview of algebraic effect handlers, and discuss
    how to combine effect handlers with parallelizable computations.
  </p>
  <h2 id="talk-mary-sheeran">“Fun with Functional Hardware Description and Verification” by Mary Sheeran</h2>
  <p>
    This talk will explain why I am still fascinated by the combination of
    hardware description and functional programming. I will show some examples
    that I have had fun with, and explain what embedded domain specific
    languages can do for us. I will also talk about my slightly crazy ongoing
    work with space and time vectors.
  </p>
  <h2 id="talk-alex-mclean">“Making people dance with Haskell” by Alex McLean</h2>
  <p>
    TidalCycles is a DSL embedded in Haskell that has got musicians embracing
    functional composition for music. Alex will tell its backstory, including
    its representation of musical pattern in types, and the international live
    coding and algorave culture around it.
  </p>
  <h2 id="talk-domen-kozar">“Developer Experience Matters” by Domen Kožar</h2>
  <p>
    We will dive into why focusing on Developer Experience leads to better
    software through the lens of Nix and Haskell.
  </p>
</section>

<h1 class="color1">Track Information</h1>
<section>
  <h2 id="track-beginner">Beginners Track by Eliane Schmidli</h2>
  <p>
    The beginners’ track this year will be loosely structured around the book
    <a href="https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html">Programming in
    Haskell</a>. We plan to have a handful of copies of this book available for
    participants of the beginners' track, but since we do not know how many
    people plan on attending, we recommend that you get yourself your own copy
    if possible and start reading on your way to ZuriHac. The slides are
    freely available online.  Please give us a thumbs up in the
    <code>#beginners</code> channel on the ZuriHac Discord as well so we know
    how many people to expect.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will reserve a special room for this, where in addition to the two
    planned sessions by Eliane Schmidli, we will have some other experienced
    Haskellers present who can help you with all sort of issues from installing
    GHC to how to structure your first project.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this track, you have to have a working Haskell installation. We
    recommend that you use <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">ghcup</a>
    to install all tools labelled "recommended" for your OS, together with
    VSCode and the
    <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell">Language Server extension</a>.
    We recommend that you do this before coming to ZuriHac. In case you have
    problems, you can ask for help on the discord channel, or when you are here.
  </p>

  <h2 id="track-generic">Generic Programming Track by Andres Löh</h2>
  <h3>Practical datatype-generic programming in Haskell</h3>
  <p>
    Datatype-generic programming is a programming technique which allows us to
    define functions systematically for large classes of datatypes, but taking
    the structure of the datatype into account. Common examples include all the
    functions that can be "derived" in Haskell, so one can think of
    datatype-generic programming as an extensible "deriving" construct.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this workshop / tutorial, we are going to look at how to write a
    number of interesting datatype-generic functions using the generics-sop
    library. Unlike previous workshops I have given on similar topics, I'm going
    to focus more on applications and actual generic functions than on the
    background and theory of datatype-generic programming.

  <h2 id="track-frp">FRP Track by Manuel Bärenz</h2>
  <p>
    In this workshop, you can learn how to write FRP (Functional Reactive
    Programming) applications.  They can be console tools, webservers,
    or even graphical applications.  You will be guided along small,
    self-contained exercises that lead you through the basics of the Rhine
    framework. There is also advanced material that you can learn in your
    own time, with Manuel available to help you with any Rhine or Haskell
    question.
  </p>
  <p>
    To come prepared, you should bring a laptop, have the repository
    <a href="https://github.com/turion/rhine-koans">rhine-koans</a> cloned, and
    all the prerequisites listed there installed.
  </p>
  <h2 id="track-agda">Programming and Proving in Agda by Jesper Cockx</h2>
  <p>
    Agda is a purely functional programming language that is similar to Haskell
    but has a more powerful dependent type system. With dependent types, you can
    express logical properties of your programs in their types and enforce them
    statically.
  </p>
  <p>
    This workshop is aimed at people with at least a basic knowledge of Haskell
    who want to learn more about Agda and dependent types in general. By the end
    of this workshop, you will be able to use dependent pattern matching and
    equational reasoning to write formally verified programs in Agda.
  </p>
  <p>
    Preparation: If you want to follow along with the exercises,
    please install Agda beforehand (<code>cabal install Agda</code> or
    <code>stack install Agda</code>).

    installation instructions can be found here</a>.

<h1>2024 Haskell Ecosystem Workshop</h1>
<section>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://haskell.foundation/">Haskell Foundation</a>,
    the <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/">OST Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences</a>,
    are organizing a two-day ecosystem workshop to be held immediately prior to
    Zurihac at the same venue.

  <h2>OST</h2>
  <p>
    The hackathon takes place at the
    <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">beautiful
    Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST (formerly HSR)</a>,
    about 40 minutes outside of Zürich city:
  </p>
  <p>
    The venue is located right next to the lake, and weather has been superb
    (25°C, 77℉) during the pre-COVID19 years, so feel free to bring your
    swimming gear!
  </p>

  <h2 id="getting-there">Getting There</h2>
  <h3>How to get there by train</h3>
  <p>
    We recommend attendees to use public transportation.  You can take the S5,
    S7 or S15 trains to get from the Zürich main station to Rapperswil. These
    trains run regularly in 30 minute intervals.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>What train tickets do I need?</summary>
    <p>
      If you stay in Zürich city, the easiest option is to get a 24 hour pass
      for <strong>all zones</strong>. It's good for all public transportation
      around Zürich, up to Rapperswil. A one-way ticket costs 17.20CHF, the 24
      hour pass 34.40CHF.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please note that the 24 hour pass is literally a 24 hour pass and can
      be used over multiple days: e.g. if you buy one on the first day of the
      Hackathon at e.g. 9.00 AM, you can still use it to take the train at
      8.00 AM the next day. This way, it is possible to buy only two tickets
      for the three-day conference.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lightly cheaper alternative to the 24 hour pass is the
      <a href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/9-oclock-daypass.html">9 O&#39;Clock day pass</a>
      which works more like a regular day pass.  However, this requires you to
      take the train to Rapperswil after 09:00 AM on weekdays, as described on
      the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can buy tickets from the SBB or ZVV vending machines, which have a
      button to use them in English rather than German on the home screen.

      Alternatively, you can use the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/buying/pages/fahrplan/fahrplan.xhtml">SBB website</a>,
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile.html">SBB mobile app</a>
      on
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.sbb.mobile.android.b2c">Android</a>
      or
      <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/sbb-mobile/id294855237">iOS</a>.
    </p>
  </details>
  <h3>How to get there by car</h3>
  <p>
    There are some paid public parking lots in walking distance from the
    campus
    (<a href="https://www.ost.ch/de/die-ost/campus/campus-rapperswil-jona">see
    here for a map</a>).  It can be difficult to find a free parking spot
    in these lots, and you can expect to pay about CHF 20 per day.  We
    therefore recommend that you come via public transport if possible.
  </p>

  <h2 id="accomodation">Accomodation</h2>
  <h3>Where to stay</h3>
  <p>
    The accommodation situation in and around Rapperswil is, unfortunately like
    every year, tight.  Summer, regardless of the weekend, is a very popular
    time in the area, with something or the other always going on.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary>What alternatives are there to Rapperswil?</summary>
    <p>
      The nearby city of Zurich has a much larger capacity of hotels and
      accommodations of varying types. The public transport to Rapperswil is
      frequent, convenient, and fast. The following stations have direct train
      connections to Rapperswil every 30 minutes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zurich Hardbrücke</li>
      <li>Zurich Hauptbahnhof</li>
      <li>Zurich Stadelhofen</li>
      <li>Zurich Oerlikon</li>
      <li>Zurich Altstetten</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      During previous years, attendees have also shared accomodation (e.g. on
      <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>).  In order to get in touch with
      fellow attendees, we recommend using the <code>#accomodation</code> channel
      in our Discord (which you can join upon registration).
    </p>
    <p>
      If weather allows for it, camping is also a very affordable and beautiful
      option for the ultimate grassroots ZuriHac festival fans.  Several people
      have stayed at
      <a href="https://www.rapperswil-zuerichsee.ch/de/besuchen/unterkunft/camping-im-strandbad-stampf">this campsite</a>
      since 2017.
