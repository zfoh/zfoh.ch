      🤔 What is ZuriHac?
    </summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> Hackathon
        in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
        coding festival organized by
        <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell</a>.
        It features fantastic keynotes, hands-on tracks, and of course lots of
        hacking and socializing!
      </p>
      <p>
        ZuriHac takes place <strong>Saturday 11 June — Monday 13 June</strong>
        2022.  We are super excited that after two years as a virtual event,
        ZuriHac 2022 will return as a <strong>physical event</strong> at the
        <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">beautiful
        Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST (formerly HSR)</a> located right
        next to lake Zürich!

    <p>
      ZuriHac is primarily a community event and a hackathon, rather than a
      conference.  Aside from the talks and tracks, attendees are encouraged to
      work together on all sorts of Haskell-related open-source projects and
      socialize!
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="/zurihac2022/projects.html">Here is a list of projects
      participants are planning to work on</a> -- feel free to add your own!
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the change in days, this year we're concentrating the talks in the
      weekend so there is a bit more time for hacking on Monday.

    <div class="content">
      <h2 id="tracks-beginner">Beginner Track</h2>
      <p>
        The beginners’ track this year will be loosely structured around the book <a
          href="https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html">Programming in Haskell</a>. We plan to have a number of copies of
        this book available for participants of the beginners' track, but since we do not know how many people plan on
        attending, we recommend that you get yourself your own copy if possible and start reading it on your way to ZuriHac.
        Please give us a thumbs up in the <code>#beginners-track channel</code> on the ZuriHac Discord as well so we know how
        many people to expect.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will reserve a special room for this, where in addition to the two planned sessions by <a
          href="https://www.ost.ch/de/person/farhad-d-mehta-1860">Farhad Mehta</a>, we will have some other experienced
        Haskellers present who can help you with all sort of issues from installing GHC to how to structure your first
        project.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this track, you have to have a working Haskell installation. We recommend that you use <a
          href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">ghcup</a> to install all tools labelled "recommended" for your OS, together
        with VSCode and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell">Language Server
          extension</a>. We recommend that you do this before comming to ZuriHac. In case you have problems, you can ask for
        help on the discord channel, or when you are here.
      </p>
      <h2 id="tracks-advanced">Advanced Track</h2>
      <p>
        Our friends from <a href="https://well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a>
        will host two in-depth technical sessions about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Saturday: Andres Löh: An Introduction to Type Systems and Operational Semantics</li>
        <li>Sunday: Armando Santos: IOSim</li>

      The hackathon takes place at the

      Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST (formerly HSR)</a>,

  <details id="getting-there">
    <summary>🚉️ Getting There</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>By Train</h3>
      <p>
        You can take the S5, S7 or S15 to get from the Zürich main station to
        Rapperswil. These trains run regularly in 30 minute intervals. Google
        maps works well for directions if you use the "public transport" tab.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you arrive at the Zürich airport, first take the train to the Zürich main
        station and then continue with S5, S7 or S15. Trains from the airport towards
        the city run every few minutes.
      </p>

      <h3>Train tickets</h3>
      <p>
        If you stay in Zürich city, the easiest option is to get a 24 hour pass
        for <strong>all zones</strong>. It's good for all public transportation
        around Zürich, up to Rapperswil. A one-way ticket costs 17.20CHF, the 24
        hour pass 34.40CHF.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note that the 24 hour pass is literally a 24 hour pass and can
        be used over multiple days: e.g. if you buy one on the first day of the
        Hackathon at e.g. 9.00 AM, you can still use it to take the train at
        8.00 AM the next day. This way, it is possible to buy only two tickets
        for the three-day conference.
      </p>

      <p>
        A lightly cheaper alternative to the 24 hour pass is the
        <a href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/9-oclock-daypass.html">9 O&#39;Clock day pass</a>
        which works more like a regular day pass.  However, this requires you to
        take the train to Rapperswil after 09:00 AM on weekdays, as described on
        the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can buy tickets from the SBB or ZVV vending machines, which have a
        button to use them in English rather than German on the home screen.

        Alternatively, you can use the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/buying/pages/fahrplan/fahrplan.xhtml">SBB website</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile.html">SBB mobile app</a>
        on
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.sbb.mobile.android.b2c">Android</a>
        or
        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/sbb-mobile/id294855237">iOS</a>.

      <div class="anchor" id="getting-there-by-car"></div>
      <h2>By Car</h2>
      <p>
        There are some paid public parking lots in walking distance from the
        campus
        (<a href="https://www.ost.ch/de/die-ost/campus/campus-rapperswil-jona">see
        here for a map</a>).  It can be difficult to find a free parking spot
        in these lots, and you can expect to pay about CHF 20 per day.  We
        therefore recommend that you come via public transport if possible.

    <summary>🏨 Accomodation</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        As for accomodation, there are two options.  You can either stay
        in Zürich, or in Rapperswil itself.  Both have advantages and
        disadvantages: there are more things to do in Zürich, but you can save
        time and transportation costs by staying in Rapperswil.

        During previous years, attendees have also shared accomodation (e.g. on
        <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>).  In order to get in touch with
        fellow attendees, we recommend using the <code>#accomodation</code> channel
        in our Discord (which you can join upon registration).

        If weather allows for it, camping is also a very affordable and beautiful
        option for the ultimate grassroots ZuriHac festival fans.  Several people
        have stayed at
        <a href="https://www.rapperswil-zuerichsee.ch/de/besuchen/unterkunft/camping-im-strandbad-stampf">this campsite</a>
        in 2017, 2018 and 2019.

      <h2>Food Trucks</h2>
      <p>
        On Saturday and Sunday from 11.00 to 15.00, the food trucks from
        <a href="https://www.tabliya.ch/">Tabliya (Egyptian)</a> and
        <a href="https://www.acapulcogrill.ch/">Acapulco (Mexican)</a> will
        be right outside the building for us.
        Both food trucks will accept credit cards.
      </p>
      <h2>Barbecue</h2>
      <p>
        On Saturday and Sunday evening, we will host a barbeque.  This is
        a bring-your-own-grillables event.  There will be a possibility to
        store stuff we didn't grill in a large fridge to reuse on Sunday and
        reduce food waste.
      </p>
      <h2>Mensa</h2>
      <p>
        During lunch hours on Monday, the Mensa restaurant at OST will be open.

        We are currently planning to hold ZuriHac 2022 as an in-person event.
        This means that visitors will need to comply with the
        <a href="https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/empfehlungen-fuer-reisende/quarantaene-einreisende.html">COVID-19 travel regulations</a>

        Switzerland can be expensive for people visiting from abroad. ZuriHac
        is a free event, but transportation, lodging, and food might discourage
        somebody without a good income from attending.  We want to make it
        easier for anyone to come, and contribute towards making the Haskell
        community exciting and diverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        For that reason, we will provide a small number of scholarships.
        Because we do not charge anything for tickets, our budget
        is limited, so we'll distribute them on a first come, first serve basis.
        Anybody accepted will be supported with an amount between 100.-
        and 500.- Swiss Francs, depending on your expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our focus is on people with limited financial means and underrepresented
        groups in tech -- the latter includes, but is not limited to: people of
        colour, anyone identifying as LGBTQIA+, women, and disabled people.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can apply by sending an email to
        <a href="mailto:scholarships@zfoh.ch">scholarships@zfoh.ch</a>, and
        tell us why are you are interested in joining the event and how a
        scholarship would help?
        Don't write an essay, a couple of sentences are enough :)
      </p>
      <p>
        After we confirm your scholarship, please book your transport and
        accomodation, and send us the receipts and IBAN information for the
        wire transfer. Once we get your receipts, we'll wire you the money.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not disclose the recipients of these scholarships, in order to
        protect their privacy.  The amount you estimate for your expenses will
        not be a factor when we consider your application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't be shy and just contact us if you feel that this can make a
        difference to you. There is no downside to applying, and we will never
        disclose your identity.
