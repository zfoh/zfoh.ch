  <h2 id="tracks">TRACK_INFO</h2>
  <p>
    We have a number of tracks for all you knowledge-hungry people.
  </p>
  <p>
    These cover any level between beginner and expert, and we've taken special care to have
    content for intermediate Haskell programmers. There has never been a better time
    to learn and apply some real-world Haskell skills!
  </p>
  <div class="tracks">

    <div class="track">
      <h3 id="beginner-track">Beginner Track</h3>
      <p>
        Julie Moronuki and Chris Martin of <a href="https://typeclasses.com/">Typeclasses</a> will teach a class for beginner Haskell programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        No prior Haskell experience is necessary, and you will learn fundamentals as well as some applied skills
        over the course of the two sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this track, you have to have a working Haskell installation.
        We'll hold an install party before the beginner track to help you with that.
        We recommend <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">ghcup</a> to install the compiler and cabal, together with
        VSCode and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell">Language Server extension</a>.
        Installing Haskell in 2021 is super easy!

      <p>
        The <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP web framework</a> is a really cool
        Haskell web framework combines the productivity of Ruby-on-Rails with the performance and robustness
        of Haskell. The community around it is growing really fast,
        in part because it comes with highly polished tools
        and doesn't need deep technical knowledge to build useful websites very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creators of IHP, <a href="https://digitallyinduced.com/">digitally induced</a>,
        will hold tutorials that teach you how to get productive with the framework.
        We recommend that even total beginners check it out,
        as some people have learned Haskell simply through using IHP for a practical application.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="track">
      <h3 id="advanced-track">Advanced Track</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to last year, we have the privilege to get
        advanced Haskell training from our friends at
        <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a>. This will take the
        form of two independent sessions, distributed over the course of two
        days.

      <div id="advanced-track-1" class="hidden">
        <h4>Saturday: Optics in the abstract by Adam Gundry</h4>
        <p class="hidden-show">
          <a href="#advanced-track-1">show more...</a>
        </p>
        <div class="hidden-content">
          <p>
            Haskell programming often involves manipulating data structures.
            Optics are a compositional abstraction representing "notions of
            substructure" as first-class values.  For example, lenses capture
            the notion of one data structure containing another, and there
            are more general optics for read-only, write-only, optional or
            repeated substructures.  Judicious use of optics can lead to
            succinct, expressive code, yet optics also have a reputation of being
            impenetrable.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this workshop, we will explore optics-the-concept in general and
            the optics library in particular.  This library provides interfaces
            for defining, combining and using various kinds of optics.  Crucially,
            these interfaces are abstract, so they can be understood without
            reference to the underlying implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also discuss how optics can help in addressing the limitations
            of Haskell's record system, in conjunction with language extensions
            such as DuplicateRecordFields, OverloadedLabels and the forthcoming
            RecordDotSyntax and NoFieldSelectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we will use optics as a case study to reflect on library
            design in Haskell.  How can we build libraries that capture powerful
            concepts and yet remain easy to use by Haskellers with a wide range of
            skill levels?
          </p>
          <p>
            This workshop will be suitable for Haskell programmers with a
            knowledge of basic Haskell concepts (polymorphic functions, data
            types, type classes).  It does not require familiarity with advanced
            type system features such as higher-rank types or type families.

            Profiling memory usage of applications has historically been a
            difficult task, thankfully in recent years the profiling tools have
            become more sophisticated and now it is quite easy to work out memory
            usage issues, if you know how to ask the right question.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this workshop, we will look at two profiling tools which can give
            you both high and low level insight into the memory usage of your
            application. Firstly, by using eventlog2html we will understand how to
            get a high-level overview of your program's memory usage. Then using
            these insights we will then learn how to use ghc-debug in order to
            answer some more precise questions about memory usage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The presentation will not require any advanced knowledge but we will
            be delving into the internals so you should be comfortable with
            that. The majority of the workshop will be given over to allowing
            participants to experiment with the tools themselves on our toy
            examples or their own projects.

        Unison is an exciting new programming language that shares Haskell's syntax
        (in addition to being implemented in it).
        The big ideas in Unison are content-addressable code and a focus on creating a language

          Collectively implement a small Angry Birds clone in Haskell using the Gloss library
          for graphics and user interaction, and the Chiphunk library for physics simulation!

          This workshop is targeted at beginners with a basic understanding of Haskell.
          You only need to know algebraic datatypes, pattern-matching, and a bit of IO.
