<h2 id="zurihac">ZuriHac</h2>
<p>
  Our main yearly event is the organisation of
  <a href="https://zurihac.info">ZuriHac</a>, a yearly Haskell Hackathon that
  attracts over 300 attendees. It is probably one of the oldest and definitely
  the largest Haskell Hackathon currently in existence.
</p>
<p>
  The first ZuriHac was organised in 2010 at the Zürich Google office by Johan
  Tibell and Christophe Poucet. Currently, we are organising it at the
  <a href="https://www.hsr.ch/">Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil</a> with the
  help of many Zürich Friends of Haskell members and volunteers.
