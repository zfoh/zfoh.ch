      🤔 What is ZuriHac?
    </summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        ZuriHac is the biggest <a href="https://haskell.org">Haskell</a> Hackathon
        in the world: a <strong>completely free</strong>, three-day grassroots
        coding festival organized by
        <a href="https://zfoh.ch/">Zürich Friends of Haskell</a>.
        It features fantastic keynotes, hands-on tracks, and of course lots of
        hacking and socializing!
      </p>
      <p>
        ZuriHac takes place <strong>Saturday 11 June — Monday 13 June</strong>
        2022.  We are super excited that after two years as a virtual event,
        ZuriHac 2022 will return as a <strong>physical event</strong> at the
        <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">beautiful
        Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST (formerly HSR)</a> located right
        next to lake Zürich!

<h1>Program</h1>
<section>
  <div class="tooltip">
    <p>
      ZuriHac is primarily a community event and a hackathon, rather than a
      conference.  Aside from the talks and tracks, attendees are encouraged to
      work together on all sorts of Haskell-related open-source projects and
      socialize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the change in days, this year we're concentrating the talks in the
      weekend so there is a bit more time for hacking on Monday.  Our schedule
      is tentative and more details will be added as we get closer to the event.

      The hackathon takes place at the
      <a href="https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus">beautiful
      Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST (formerly HSR)</a>,
      about 40 minutes outside of Zürich city:
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-left: 2em;">
      OST, Campus Rapperswil<br>
      Oberseestrasse 10<br>
      8640 Rapperswil
    </p>
    <p>
      The venue is located right next to the lake, and weather has been superb
      (25°C, 77℉) during the pre-COVID19 years, so feel free to bring your
      swimming gear!

    <summary>🚉️ Getting There</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <h2>By Train</h3>
      <p>
        You can take the S7 or S15 to get from the Zürich main station to
        Rapperswil.  These trains run regularly in 30 minute and 60 minute
        intervals, respectively.  Google maps works well for directions if you
        use the "public transport" tab.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you arrive at the Zürich airport, first take the train to the Zürich main
        station and then continue with S7 or S15. Trains from the airport towards
        the city run every few minutes.
      </p>

      <h3>Train tickets</h3>
      <p>
        If you stay in Zürich city, the easiest option is to get a 24 hour pass
        for <strong>all zones</strong>. It's good for all public transportation
        around Zürich, up to Rapperswil. A one-way ticket costs 17.20CHF, the 24
        hour pass 34.40CHF.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note that the 24 hour pass is literally a 24 hour pass and can
        be used over multiple days: e.g. if you buy one on the first day of the
        Hackathon at e.g. 9.00, you can still use it to take the train at 8.00
        the next day. This way, it is possible to buy only two tickets for the
        three-day conference.
      </p>

      <p>
        A lightly cheaper alternative to the 24 hour pass is the
        <a href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/9-oclock-daypass.html">9 O&#39;Clock day pass</a>
        which works more like a regular day pass.  However, this requires you to
        take the train to Rapperswil after 09:00 on Friday, as described on the
        website.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can buy tickets from the SBB or ZVV vending machines, which have a
        button to use them in English rather than German on the home screen.

        Alternatively, you can use the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/service/apps/ticket-app.html">ZVV ticket app</a>
        on
        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mnc.android.zvvticket">Android</a>
        or
        <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/zvv-tickets/id1033896474?mt=8">iOS</a>.
      </p>

      <div class="anchor" id="getting-there-by-car"></div>
      <h2>By Car</h2>
      <p>
        There are some paid public parking lots in walking distance from the
        campus
        (<a href="https://www.hsr.ch/en/contact-and-directions/">see here for a
        map</a>).  It can be difficult to find a free parking spot in these lots,
        and you can expect to pay about CHF 20 per day.  We therefore recommend
        that you come via public transport if possible.

    <summary>🏨 Accomodation</summary>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        As for accomodation, there are two options.  You can either stay
        in Zürich, or in Rapperswil itself.  Both have advantages and
        disadvantages: there are more things to do in Zürich, but you can save
        time and transportation costs by staying in Rapperswil.
      </p>

      <p>Here are some hotels close to the venue:</p>
      <ul>

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        During previous years, attendees have also shared accomodation (e.g. on
        <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>).  In order to get in touch with
        fellow attendees, we recommend using the <code>#accomodation</code> channel
        in our Discord (which you can join upon registration).
      </p>

      <p>
        If weather allows for it, camping is also a very affordable and beautiful
        option for the ultimate grassroots ZuriHac festival fans.  Several people
        have stayed at
        <a href="https://www.rapperswil-zuerichsee.ch/de/besuchen/unterkunft/camping-im-strandbad-stampf">this campsite</a>
        in 2017, 2018 and 2019.
