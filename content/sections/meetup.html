It is not your standard conference with papers and presentations, but features fantastic keynotes, hands-on tracks, hacking on many of your favourite projects, and of course lots of socializing!**</p> <p>**This year’s keynote speakers currently include Lennart Augustson (current holder of the record for most number of Haskell compiler implementations), Rebecca Skinner (author of “Effective Haskell”), and Brent Yorgey (of “Diagrams” and “Swarm” fame). Further keynote speaker and track announcements will be made on our website. For an idea of what to expect, have a look at last year’s schedule on &lt;[<a href="https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2024](https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2024/)\&gt" class="linkified">https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2024](https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2024/)\&gt</a>; and a video impression of last year’s event at &lt;[<a href="https://youtu.be/SMIdDqZxrUk?si=Jvl1LpuanFJHglSC](https://youtu.be/SMIdDqZxrUk?si=Jvl1LpuanFJHglSC)\&gt" class="embedded">https://youtu.be/SMIdDqZxrUk?si=Jvl1LpuanFJHglSC](https://youtu.be/SMIdDqZxrUk?si=Jvl1LpuanFJHglSC)\&gt</a>;\.**</p> <p>**We also welcome beginners or people unfamiliar to Haskell who are curious to learn more. There will be an organised beginners’ track as well as many mentors from the Haskell community happy to answer all your questions.**</p> <p>**ZuriHac Prelude: Two days prior to ZuriHac, the Haskell Foundation and OST will organize the Haskell Ecosystem Workshop (HEW) and the Haskell Implementors’ Workshop (HIW - formerly co-located with the ICFP) at the same venue. Details will be posted to the ZuriHac website as they become available.**</p> <p>**You can find more information about the event and register at &lt;[<a href="https://zurihac.info](https://zurihac.info/)\&gt" class="linkified">https://zurihac.info](https://zurihac.info/)\&gt</a>;\.**</p> <p>**The event is free for participants. This is only possible with the help of our generous supporters, who are currently:**</p> <p>**\- The Haskell Foundation**<br/>**\- IOHK**<br/>**\- OST**<br/>**\- Tweag**<br/>**\- Well\-Typed**</p> <p>**In case you would like to support ZuriHac, as a company or as an individual, please get in touch with us.
