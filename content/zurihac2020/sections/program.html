        Philip is a professor at the

        a critical role in the design of Haskell and
        worked on many things that we now take for granted such as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class">type classes</a>
        and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">Monads</a>.
        He also made important contributions to languages other than
        Haskell—for example introducing Generics in Java 5.

  <div class="anchor" id="how-it-works"></div>
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    ZuriHac focuses on three goals:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to work on interesting open source projects;</li>
    <li>to learn more about our favorite programming language; and</li>
    <li>to have fun and build a community!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is not a conference.  Most of the time is reserved to work on
    projects together.  At the start of the Hackathon maintainers get a few
    moments to present their project.  If you want, you can join any of these
    projects and learn, contribute code, write documentation, or make any other
    sort of progress.  There will be something for all skill levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course — in between hacking — we love learning from some of the most
    interesting Haskellers out there, so we have a couple of
    <a href="#speakers">invited talks from several amazing people</a>
    from both industry and academia, in addition to some free
    <a href="#tracks">tracks you can follow</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="tracks"></div>
  <h2>Tracks</h2>

  <div class="anchor" id="advanced-track"></div>
  <h3>Advanced track</h3>
  <p>
    The Haskell experts from <a href="http://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a>
    will teach a two-part course in the advanced track.  The two sessions cover
    different subjects and are completely independent.  They will take place on
    Friday and Saturday afternoon.  The exact topics will be announced here
    before the event.

    We're excited that
    <a href="https://twitter.com/argumatronic">Julie Moronuki</a> from
    <a href="https://joyofhaskell.com/">Joy of Haskell</a> and
    <a href="https://typeclasses.com/">Type Classes</a> will be teaching
    the beginners course again this year.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beginners course focuses on Haskell language fundamentals and requires
    no prior experience with the language.  It will take place in two
    parts, on Friday and Saturday afternoon.  We will post detailed installation
    instructions here prior to the event, so you will be able to dive right in!
