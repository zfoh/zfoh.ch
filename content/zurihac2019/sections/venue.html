  <p>
    The Hackathon mainly takes place in two buildings: Building 1 and
    Building 4.  Detailed info on the different rooms will be announced later.
  </p>
  <p>
    The venue is located right next to the lake, and weather has been superb
    (25°C, 77℉) during the previous years, so feel free to bring your swimming
    gear!
  </p>

  <h2 id="getting-there">Getting there</h2>
  <p>
    You can take the S7 or S15 to get from the Zurich main station to
    Rapperswil.  These trains run regularly in 30 minute and 60 minute
    intervals, respectively.  Google maps works well for directions if you use
    the "public transport" tab.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you arrive at the Zurich airport, first take the train to the Zurich main
    station and then continue with S7 or S15. Trains from the airport towards
    the city run every few minutes.
  </p>

  <h2 id="accomodation">Accomodation</h2>
  <p>
    As for accomodation, there are two options.  You can either stay in Zurich,
    or in Rapperswil itself.  Both have advantages and disadvantages: there are
    more things to do in Zurich, but you can save time and transportation costs
    by staying in Rapperswil.
  </p>

  <p>
    During previous years, attendees have also shared accomodation (e.g. on
    <a href="https://airbnb.com">Airbnb</a>).  In order to get in touch with
    fellow attendees, we recommend using the <code>#accomodation</code> channel
    in our <a href="https://slack.zurihac.info">Slack chat</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If weather allows for it, camping is also a very affordable and beautiful
    option for the ultimate grassroots ZuriHac festival fans.  Several people
    have stayed at
    <a href="https://www.rapperswil-zuerichsee.ch/de/besuchen/unterkunft/camping-im-strandbad-stampf">this campsite</a>
    in 2017 and 2018.
  </p>

  <h2 id="train-tickets">Train tickets</h2>

  <p>
    If you stay in Zurich city, the easiest option is to get a 24 hour pass for
    <strong>all zones</strong>. It's good for all public transportation around
    Zurich, up to Rapperswil. A one-way ticket costs 17.20CHF, the 24 hour pass
    34.40CHF.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that the 24 hour pass is literally a 24 hour pass and can be
    used over multiple days: e.g. if you buy one on the first day of the
    Hackathon at e.g. 9.00, you can still use it to take the train at 8.00 the
    next day. This way, it is possible to buy only two tickets for the three-day
    conference.
  </p>

  <p>
    A lightly cheaper alternative to the 24 hour pass is the
    <a href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/travelcards-and-tickets/tickets/9-oclock-daypass.html">9 O&#39;Clock day pass</a>
    which works more like a regular day pass.  However, this requires you to
    take the train to Rapperswil after 09:00 on Friday, as described on the
    website.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can buy tickets from the SBB or ZVV vending machines, which have a
    button to use them in English rather than German on the home screen.

    Alternatively, you can use the
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zvv.ch/zvv/en/service/apps/ticket-app.html">ZVV ticket app</a>
    on
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mnc.android.zvvticket">Android</a>
    or
