  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>
    ZuriHac focuses on three goals:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>to work on interesting open source projects;</li>
    <li>to learn more about our favorite programming language; and</li>
    <li>to have fun and build a community!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ZuriHac is not a conference.  Most of the time is reserved to work on
    <a href="#projects">projects</a> together.  At the start of the Hackathon
    maintainers get a few moments to present their project.  If you want, you
    can join any of these projects and learn, contribute code, write
    documentation, or make any other sort of progress.  There will be something
    for all skill levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course — in between hacking —  we love learning from some of the most
    interesting Haskellers out there, so we have a couple of
    <a href="#speakers">keynotes from several amazing people</a>
    from both industry and academia.

    In addition to that, there are some free
    <a href="#beginner-track">courses you can</a>
    <a href="#advanced-track">take as well</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can identify volunteer <strong>mentors</strong> from the dark blue
    Zurihac shirt.  They welcome any questions you may have about Haskell, so
    please grab them if you have any issues or questions.

  <h2>Tracks</h2>
  <!-- <p>
    We want to make the event accessible to Haskellers at all levels.  This is
    why we have dedicated mentors and tracks at
  </p> -->
  <div class="anchor" id="beginner-track"></div>
  <h3>Beginner Track</h3>

  <img style="float: right; max-width: 100px; margin: 0px 12px 12px 12px;
                border: 2px solid #258bcd"
      src="/images/speakers/ryan-moore.jpg">
  <p>
    The beginners track features a <em>free course</em> focused on Haskell
    language fundamentals with no prior experience to the language assumed or
    required.
  </p>
  <p>
    Topics that will be covered include:
  </p>
  <ol>
      <li>Binding values and scope</li>
      <li>Functions &amp; their first class nature</li>
      <li>Closures, partial application, and composition</li>
      <li>"Built In" &amp; "Create Your Own" types</li>
      <li>Type classes</li>
      <li>Working with lists and text</li>
      <li>Reading &amp; writing data to files</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Important update:</strong> unfortunately,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/argumatronic">Julie</a>,
    will not be able to make it to ZuriHac this year.
    <a href="https://twitter.com/panicwhenever">Ryan Moore</a> will be teaching
    the beginners course in her absence.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="advanced-track"></div>
  <h3>Advanced Track</h3>
  <p>
    The Haskell experts from <a href="http://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a>
    will teach a two-part course in the advanced track.  The two sessions are
    completely independent and take place on Friday and Saturday afternoon.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Duncan Coutts will lead a session on <em>Evaluation &amp;
        Performance</em>.  He will teach you how to properly reason about
        evaluation in Haskell program, and discuss performance pitfalls.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Adam Gundry will host a session about Advanced Types, so you can learn
        about various GHC type system extensions.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div class="anchor" id="ghc-track"></div>
  <h3>GHC Track</h3>
  <p>
    This year we will again feature a dedicated GHC track to foster
    contributions to GHC and teach newcomers how to participate in GHC's
    development.  It was a great success last year, and this year we are even
    more excited about the incredible programme we have for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following workshops will take place:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Richard Eisenberg</strong>
    <br>
    <b>Friday 14:15 - 15:15</b>
    <br>
    A high-level overview on the GHC compilation pipeline.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Matthew Pickering</strong>
    <br>
    <b>Friday 15:30 - 16:00</b>
    <br>
    Tools for working on GHC.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Andrey Mokhov</strong>
    <br>
    <b>Saturday 13:30 - 14:00</b>
    <br>
    Hadrian build system.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Simon Peyton Jones</strong>
    <br>
    <b>Saturday 14:15 - 15:15</b>
    <br>
    Understanding GHC's type inference engine.
    <br>
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="docs-track"></div>
  <h3>Docs Track</h3>
  <img style="float: left; max-width: 100px; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;
                border: 2px solid #258bcd"

  <p>
    Writing good docs is a non-trivial task, and can hugely improve how your
    users see your software.
    <a href="https://twitter.com/baitman">Beth Aitman</a>, technical writer at
    our sponsor Digital Asset, will teach you how write effective and clear
    documentation.  With the right conceptual understanding you might even start
    loving to write docs for your projects!
  </p>
  <p>
    This track consists of a talk at 11.00 on Saturday, followed by
    collaborative doc writing for any projects that are interested.
  </p>

  <div class="anchor" id="projects"></div>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
    Like each year, ZuriHac hosts many projects by and for attendees.
    <a href="/zurihac2019/projects.html">You can see the full list here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before the Hackathon, we will highlight a few projects from our sponsors
    here.
