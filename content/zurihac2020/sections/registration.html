<section>
  <p>
    The Hackathon is completely free but the number of participants is limited
    to 500 people.  To this end, it is very important to us that you timely
    cancel your registration in case you cannot attend.  Around two months
    before the Hackathon, we will ask you to <em>confirm</em> your registration
    and after that you will be able to access your ticket.

  <h2>Scholarships</h2>
  <p>
    Switzerland can be expensive for people visiting from abroad. ZuriHac is a
    free event, but transportation, lodging, and food might discourage somebody
    without a good income from attending.  We want to make it easier for anyone
    to come, and contribute towards making the Haskell community exciting and
    diverse.
  </p>
  <p>
    For that reason, we will provide a small number of scholarships this year.
    Because we do not charge anything for tickets, our budget is limited
    and we can only support attendees by reimbursing between 100.- and 500.-
    Swiss Francs, depending on your expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our focus is on people with limited financial means and underrepresented
    groups in tech -- the latter includes, but is not limited to: people of
    colour, anyone identifying as LGBTQIA+, women, and disabled people.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can apply by sending an email to
    <a href="mailto:scholarships@zfoh.ch">scholarships@zfoh.ch</a>, and include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A rough breakdown of your cost estimates (flight, train tickets,
      hotel/hostel/airbnb, food...).
    </li>
    <li>
      Why are you interested in functional programming?  Don't write an essay:
      one or two sentences should be enough.
    </li>
    <li>
      What makes you eligible?  Again, keep this brief, and please only
      share what you are comfortable with.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We will not disclose the recipients of these scholarships, in order to
    protect their privacy.  The amount you estimate for your expenses will not
    be a factor when we consider your application.
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't be shy and just contact us if you feel that this can make a difference
    to you. There is no downside to applying, and we will never disclose your
    identity.
