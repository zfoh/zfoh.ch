No prior knowledge of Nix is required, though familiarity with Linux or OS concepts will be helpful.</p> <p>Speaker bio: Alex has over a decade of experience making computers work for teams and projects of all sizes. As a champion of functional and declarative paradigms, he has managed to sneak Nix into both embedded systems and large-scale distributed projects. He is an organizer of international Haskell and Nix meetups, and likes to share his expertise while learning from the community. His mission: to make technology just a bit less frustrating for everyone.</p> <p>The lecture will take place in the lecture theatre 3.008 at the OST campus in Rapperswil.</p> </div><div class="right past-meetups"><h3>Past meetups</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/haskellerz/events/304434274/">M.
