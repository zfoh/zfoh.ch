  <h2 id="tracks">TRACK_INFO</h2>
  <p>
    We have a number of tracks for all you knowledge-hungry people.
  </p>
  <p>
    These cover any level between beginner and expert, and we've taken special care to have
    content for intermediate Haskell programmers. There has never been a better time
    to learn and apply some real-world Haskell skills!
  </p>
  <div class="tracks">

    <div class="track">
      <h3 id="beginner-track">Beginner Track</h3>
      <p>
        Julie Moronuki and Chris Martin of <a href="https://typeclasses.com/">Typeclasses</a> will teach a class for beginner Haskell programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        No prior Haskell experience is necessary, and you will learn fundamentals as well as some applied skills
        over the course of the two sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this track, you have to have a working Haskell installation.
        We'll hold an install party before the beginner track to help you with that.
        We recommend <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/">ghcup</a> to install the compiler and cabal, together with
        VSCode and the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell">Language Server extension</a>.
        Installing Haskell in 2021 is super easy!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="track">
      <h3 id="ihp-workshop">IHP workshop</h3>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP web framework</a> is an
        up-and-coming Haskell web framework that has been compared to Ruby-on-Rails. It has
        been received with a lot of excitement, since it comes with highly polished tools
        and doesn't need deep technical knowledge to build useful websites very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creators of IHP, <a href="https://digitallyinduced.com/">digitally induced</a>,
        will hold tutorials that teach you how to get productive with the framework.
        We recommend that even total beginners check it out,
        as some people have learned Haskell simply through using IHP for a practical application.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="track">
      <h3 id="advanced-track">Advanced Track</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to last year, we have the privilege to get advanced Haskell training from
        our friends at <a href="https://www.well-typed.com/">Well-Typed</a>. This will take
        the form of two independent sessions, distributed over the course of two days.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watch this space for the announcement of the specific topics, or check out last year's
        recordings for a taste:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/pwnrfREbhWY">Datatype-Generic Programming</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/RknM0j138PE">Haskell and InfoSec</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="track">
      <h3 id="unison-workshop">Unison workshop</h3>
      <p>
        Unison is an exciting new programming language that shares Haskell's syntax
        (in addition to being implemented in it).
        The big ideas in Unison are content-addressable code and a focus on creating a language
        in which it is natural to express distributed systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rúnar Bjarnason of <a href="https://www.unisonweb.org/unisoncomputing/">Unison Computing</a>
        will give you an intro to the language, and hold a hands-on tutorial.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can't wait, check out the <a href="https://youtu.be/gCWtkvDQ2ZI">2019 Strangeloop</a>
        introduction to the language.
